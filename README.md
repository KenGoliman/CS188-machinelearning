This Project is one of several I undertook as a pair in the CS188(Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) course in UC Berkeley.

All code edited by me is in the models.py file. All other files are for grading and/or testing purpose, are not edited or written by me, and can be ignored

This project involves three parts: the first is  some simple practice with Perceptrons and Regression(Linear and Non-Linear). 
The second involves using a Regression model to correctly classify handwritten digits into 10 classes. We were able to achieve an accuracy rate of 97+% through our model.
The third involves using a Recurrent Neural Network to train a model to correctly identify a body of text and differentiate it among 5 languages(English, Spanish, Finnish, Dutch, or Polish). 
We were able to achieve an accuracy rate of 81+% through our model.
